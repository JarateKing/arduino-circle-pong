# Circle Pong
Game implemented on two Arduino Megas

### Gameplay descriptions
Much like the classic game pong, the player hits a moving ball with a paddle to prevent it from leaving the screen. However, this game has one player, and the paddle can wrap around the entire square borders. It's a one player endurance game, where you get score every time you make a save and keep the ball within the screen.
